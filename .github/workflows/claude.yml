            Read the reference documentation in .review-docs/ before reviewing.
            Read .claude-plugin/marketplace.json and every plugins/*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json to check version consistency.

            Focus your review on:
            1. Version consistency between marketplace.json and plugin.json files (BLOCKING if mismatched)
            2. Plugin structure compliance with official documentation
            3. YAML frontmatter format in skills
            4. No secrets or credentials committed
            5. CLAUDE.md not accidentally deleted

            If changes look correct and versions are consistent, say so clearly.
            Keep feedback concise, actionable, and directly tied to the diff.

            ## Reference Documentation

            Before reviewing, read these three reference documents that were downloaded to .review-docs/:
            - .review-docs/plugin-marketplaces.html - Official marketplace documentation
            - .review-docs/plugins.html - Official plugin documentation
            - .review-docs/skills.html - Official skills documentation

            Use these as the source of truth for best practices around plugin structure, skill format, and marketplace configuration.

            ## Review Checklist

            ### 1. Best Practices Compliance
            Compare the PR changes against the reference documentation:
            - Plugin structure follows the official format (plugin.json manifest, correct directory layout)
            - Skills use proper YAML frontmatter format
            - Marketplace entries have required fields
            - Any new plugins or skills follow documented conventions

            ### 2. Version Consistency (CRITICAL)
            This is the most important check. Examine ALL version numbers:

            a) Read .claude-plugin/marketplace.json and every plugins/*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
            b) If any plugin's plugin.json version was changed in this PR, the corresponding entry in marketplace.json MUST be updated to match
            c) The marketplace.json version for each plugin MUST equal the version in that plugin's plugin.json
            d) If a plugin's skills or agents were modified, the plugin version MUST be incremented

            Report any version mismatches as a blocking issue.

            ### 3. General Code Review
            - Documentation is clear and accurate
            - No secrets or credentials in committed files
            - Changes are consistent with the repository's existing patterns
            - CLAUDE.md is not accidentally deleted or modified without good reason

            ## Output Format

            Provide your review as a structured comment with:
            - A summary of what the PR does
            - Version check results (pass/fail with details)
            - Best practices compliance (any issues found)
            - General observations or suggestions

            IMPORTANT: Always end your review with:
